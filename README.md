# public-code

I have a lot of code I'm working on in private repos, but here's some I've chosen to make public. Why?
1) friendly people can get snippets of what I'm working on (Hi KOAers!)
2) handing in assignments involving code I host in private repos.

If you are one of my teachers and you are reading this:
1) you're curious and explored the repo after checking the code i handed in
2) the link i gave you accidentally directed you here, whoops. Attempt to locate the file that seems to be the right one and email me for an updated link.

I have a few more public repos! Check my profile.
- Advent of Code 2020: this is my work for the Advent of Code event 2020, all done in JS.
- horace: a fork of the KOA Horace Bot repo. Contributions from here will hopefully get merged back there.
